JoelCare
========

A personal tool for healthcare providers to manage patients and their medical records with simplicity! 

Admittedly, this is a personal projcet for a first-time coder with only a couple months of coding under his belt.

However, rather than just read instructions all day, I want to dive deep and make a project I can be proud of later.
Healthcare is a personal interest of mine and when it comes to the management of electronic medical-records, the benefits
have not been recognized by the bulk of providers throughout the country. 

JoelCare is a simple interface that allows providers to make prescriptions, schedule appointments, and send referrals
in seconds. By utilizing a patient's medical history and insurance, it can inform providers which meds are acceptable to
the patient based on his/her history and inform the provider of which outside referrals can be covered under a patient's
plan. This will reduce tremenous red tape that ties the healthcare field up and creates headaches for millions. 

Besides, healthcare is supposed to fix headaches, not cause them!
